- It looks like you didn't update your GitHub profile to include all of the info we instructed (e.g., a photo, requested contact information). Please do this as soon as possible.
- Making use of [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org) features such as headers, lists, basic font formatting, links, images, etc., can go a long way. Be sure to spend some time making sure you have the basics down, and try to review some examples online to get a better sense for what others do.
- You may want to fix up how you do the header of your submission. For reference, see https://www.traviswpeters.com/cs476-2021-spring/labs#example-structure-of-a-lab-report-readmemd

NOTE: You don't need the '\' character to end lines. In fact, yours show up in the rendered markdown, which looks odd. Always check what the final rendered output looks like on GitHub!
