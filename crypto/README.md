Task 1: 

Cryptography is the discipline of encoding and decoding messages. It is the study and practice for secure communications in the
presence of third parties. It deals with developing and analyzing protocols which prevents malicious third parties from retrieving 
information being shared between two entities thereby following the various aspects of information security. Cryptography can solve
a lot of security issues by not letting a lot of vital getting stolen or manipulated since cryptography enables the sender and the 
receivers beig the only one who can see the message. One of the issues is that anyone with the key can decipher the information.
The big idea behind it is, the sender would use a set of rules to encode the message, which makes it safe and secure and the reciever 
would need a key to decode it. 


Task 2: I used the website https://www.101computing.net/frequency-analysis to help with this task.

One thing I noticed is that, these tasks can be done on the website, since my VM decided to hate me for the same reason my cat hates 
me, I resorted to doing the tasks on the website. It was also mentioned on Slack that this can by done using the website.
