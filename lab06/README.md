Task 2:

First we need to make sure that the picture is working. Then we start the encryption. We can start encrypting the picture and we 
have to set the header of the file correctly so that the encrypted file will be recognized as a legitimate bmp file. We can figure
out some of the information about the picture by viewing it. The whole picuture is encrypted but it is possible to know what the 
picture was before encryption..

Task 5:


Here we play around with IV values and see how important having a unique IV is to keep our data from being stolen. 
The same key and IV has to be used to create the cipher text and bring it back to its original form. Using different 
IV would cause it to have different text than original.
