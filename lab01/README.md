Threat Model: \
![Model](https://github.com/Rania-ME/csci-476-594-spring2021-private/blob/main/lab01/threat_model.jpg) \
The strengths of the threath model are as follows: \
1) It considers a lot of the follwing threats that this scenario could face \
2) It mostly considers that the computer isn't password protected when the user walks away from it. \
The weaknesses of the threat model are as follows: \
1) It only shows one case that could happen should the laptop be password protected, that being that the laptop could be stolen. \
2) In the diagram it wasn't considered if an attacker downloads viruses in it or not. \
What can be improved in the future: \
1) More scenarios where the laptop is password protected should be explored. \
2) There could be more sub-branches of when the laptop gets stolen and the risks associated with that scenario.
